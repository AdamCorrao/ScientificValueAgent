Figures
=======

Unpack ``results.tar.bz2`` into this directory in order to use the plotting notebooks.

Note, the notebooks here generally output individual pieces of the figures in the manuscript in ``svg`` format. Significant post-processing was performed in an ``svg`` graphics editor (in the case of this work, Inkscape).
