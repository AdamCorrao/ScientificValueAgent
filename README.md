The Scientific Value Agent (SVA) is a collection of tools for Gaussian Process (GP)-based Bayesian Optimization, particularly for use in epistemic experimentation (experiments in which you know nothing, have nothing to optimize and want to simply explore the experimental space as completely as you can).

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the Scientific Value Agent, please consider citing our [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matt.2023.11.012) in Matter. The software corresponding to this manuscript is tagged as [`v1.1.0`](https://github.com/matthewcarbone/ScientificValueAgent/tree/v1.1.0).


# üöÄ Examples

We have a few notebooks to get started with the basics of GP-based Bayesian Optimization, which can be found [here](https://github.com/matthewcarbone/ScientificValueAgent/tree/master/notebooks). The links below open in Google Colab notebooks.
